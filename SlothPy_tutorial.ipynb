    "As you already should notice (when reading the docstring of calculate_mth method) SlopthPy provides you full control over the amount of CPUs you want to assign to your calculation and threads to be used. Computationally demanding methods are parallelized using a certain amount of separate processes - the number of processes that will be used is (number of CPUs) // (number of threads). Additionally, in the Note section of each method, the user is informed over what quantity the job will be parallelized. In the case of calcualte_mth, the work is distributed over field values (here 50). So using for example 10 parallel processes each will compute the magnetisation for 5 values of the field. As default, SlothPy uses all available logical cores with 1 thread for the linear algebra libraries. For jobs with a very high number of points to be parallelized, you should benefit from a greater number of processes (not including time for Python's multiprocessing setup for a huge amount of data). On the other hand with increasing matrices size it is beneficial to use more threads for operations such as diagonalization etc. It is not a trivial task to choose good settings for very demanding calculations that is why we provide, within SlothPy, the autotune module to do it for you. It tests all possible meaningful setups and gives you time estimates for each of them. It takes some time to do this (because it actually truly does a part of the calculations to benchmark them) so it is advised to use it for jobs that will take hours. To demonstrate it with very small matrices provided in our file (they are 364 x 364 - that is how many SO states are there) we will run two examples using all available CPUs on your machine (if you want to leave some you should change number_cpu = 0 to your desired number):"
